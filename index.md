## Papers

__Measuring the Diffusion of Innovation: A Reassessment of Knowledge Spillovers Using Machine Learning__ (*Job Market Paper*)


*Abstract*: The ideas of new inventions are captured by the texts of patents. Using unsupervised machine learning methods, I convert patent abstracts (which describe the new invention) into vector representations, and measure their knowledge relatedness using cosine similarity. Knowledge spillovers has typically been proxied using patent citations, which finds a large role for geographic localization: local patents have 0.24-0.30 standard deviations more citations from the same city compared to a non-local control. However, proxying for knowledge spillovers using similarity in patent texts finds much smaller localization effects: local inventions are 0-0.08 S.D.s more related compared to non-local inventions. This suggests that while local firms and inventors form technological clusters, these clusters may generate similar innovations to clusters in different cities. One explanation is that access and use of non-patent technical knowledge has a "homogenizing" effect on innovation across locations.

__Assessing the quality of management and business practices from employee job reviews__


*Abstract*: Employee job reviews contain information on many firm characteristics unobservable from the outside. Job review sites such as Glassdoor and Indeed have become increasingly utilized by both job seekers and current employees to better understand workplace culture and conditions. I collect over 1.2 million job reviews from Indeed.com, matched to firm level data was procured from Compustat. I use machine learning methods (Natural Language Processing and Random Forests) to obtain qualitative data about firms across the dimensions of worker satisfaction, management quality, and workplace quality. First, I assess which words and phrases the predict poor firm performance within an industry. Second, I derive an index of management quality based on review phrases mentioning management. Finally, I evaluate when employee job satisfaction coincides or conflicts with firm performance outcomes.

__Technology and governance: past, present, future__


*Abstract*: The Defense Department was indispensable to funding and shaping the course of science and computing in the 20th century, and continues to provide extensive financial support for cutting edge artificial intelligence technology. How did this embedded relationship inform the research agenda for computer science? Using Natural Language Processing, I examine the commonalities and differences in the themes of DOD funded and non-funded patents and academic research over time. Then, I evaluate (i) how DOD priorities affected the trajectory of computer science research; (ii) whether current trends in DOD funded research, particularly in Artificial Intelligence, poses risks to civil liberties; (iii) what are the broader implications for the nature of governance as states around the world adopt advanced AI technologies.
