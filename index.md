__Measuring the Diffusion of Innovation: A Reassessment of Knowledge Spillovers Using Machine Learning__ (*Job Market Paper*)

__

*Abstract*: The ideas of new invention are captured by the text of a patent. Empirical measures of knowledge flows have relied on citations, which reflect the influence of other patents on an invention but not external sources of knowledge. I use unsupervised machine learning methods to convert patent abstracts (which are descriptions of the invention) to numerical vector space representations. Knowledge spillovers are measured using the similarity across patent text vectors. I find that geographic localization effects are insignificant to modest: prior to controlling technological proximity, within technology field patents from the same city are about 0.03-0.08 standard deviations more similar than patents from different cities. Including further technology controls reduces estimates from insignificant to 0.04. By contrast, citations based measures find that local patents have 0.24-0.30 standard deviations more citations from the same city compared to a non-local control. I also find evidence that differentiation may play a minor role in determining innovation for technologically proximate rivals seeking to broaden the scope of their patents, and that this motivation is more pronounced for local rivals. These findings indicate that geographic localization of knowledge spillovers (i) may not be a strong driver of agglomeration, as suggested by standard citations-based analyses; (ii) affects local innovation in a nuanced manner.
