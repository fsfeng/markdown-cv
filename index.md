## Papers

__The Proximity of Ideas: An Analysis of Patent Text Using Machine Learning__ (*Job Market Paper*)


*Abstract*: This paper introduces a measure of proximity in ideas using unsupervised machine learning. I explore knowledge relationships in innovative ideas by deriving vector space representations of patent abstract text using Document Vectors (Doc2Vec), and using cosine similarity to measure their proximity in ideas space. I illustrate the potential uses of this method with an application to localization in knowledge spillovers. In the first case, I use the standard citations approach in measuring localization, but use text similarity to select a control case patent instead of USPC class. While this improves matching on unobserved technological differences, I find that local patents still receive about 0.9-1.4 times more local citations than the non-local control. This may partially be explained by the role of patent lawyers in determining the localization patterns of citations. As an alternative to citations, I calculate the localization in idea proximity using patent text similarity. I find less evidence of localization: within a technology field, patents within the same city are 0.02-0.06 times more similar to each other than patents from other cities. These findings indicate that localization effects may indeed be smaller than standard citations methods suggest. As ideas proximity provide a different lens into knowledge relationships, I also discuss some implications and potential limitations in the use of text similarity methods.

__Assessing the quality of management and business practices from employee job reviews__


*Abstract*: Employee job reviews contain information on many firm characteristics unobservable from the outside. Job review sites such as Glassdoor and Indeed have become increasingly utilized by both job seekers and current employees to better understand workplace culture and conditions. I collect over 1.2 million job reviews from Indeed.com, matched to firm level data was procured from Compustat. I use machine learning methods (Natural Language Processing and Random Forests) to obtain qualitative data about firms across the dimensions of worker satisfaction, management quality, and workplace quality. First, I assess which words and phrases the predict poor firm performance within an industry. Second, I derive an index of management quality based on review phrases mentioning management. Finally, I evaluate when employee job satisfaction coincides or conflicts with firm performance outcomes.

__Technology and governance: past, present, future__


*Abstract*: The Defense Department was indispensable to funding and shaping the course of science and computing in the 20th century, and continues to provide extensive financial support for cutting edge artificial intelligence technology. How did this embedded relationship inform the research agenda for computer science? Using Natural Language Processing, I examine the commonalities and differences in the themes of DOD funded and non-funded patents and academic research over time. Then, I evaluate (i) how DOD priorities affected the trajectory of computer science research; (ii) whether current trends in DOD funded research, particularly in Artificial Intelligence, poses risks to civil liberties; (iii) what are the broader implications for the nature of governance as states around the world adopt advanced AI technologies.
